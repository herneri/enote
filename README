enote allows notes to be written on the CLI in a simple manner without
unneeded features. Instead of trying to manage scattered text files,
users can manage their notes in one place on their Unix-like system.

enote provides the following options:

-w		Write a new note, use ">E" to finish writing
-r		Read a note
-d		Delete a note
-l		List all current notes
-lc		List all notes in columns
